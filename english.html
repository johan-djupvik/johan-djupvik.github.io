        <h2>Port of Djupvik</h2>
        <article>
          <h3>On the east coast of Gotland</h3>
          <p>
                The Port of Djupvik is located on the east coast of Gotland very close to the
                beautiful smaller island Lilla Karlsö. Adjacent to the port is a small and
                charming fishing-village which, during summer, comes to life with a relaxed
                and welcoming buzz. </p>
          <p>
            Close by and situated with a fantastic view over the port is Djupvik Hotel,
            with modern standard and with its own popular restaurant. </p>
          <p>
            Both the port and the fishing village have a beautiful view of two popular
            bird islands called “Lilla Karlsö” and “Stora Karlsö”. </p>
          <p>
            The coastline south of Djupvik, called “Ekstakusten” is incredibly beautiful
            and invites to nice scenery and views on foot, by bike or by car. </p>
          <p>
            North, and connected to the port, is a small sandy beach which is well soothed
            for a nice swim. </p>
          <p>
            The distance from the port to Lilla Karlsö is about 2 nautical miles and it is
            about twice as long to Stora Karlsö (4nm). </p>
          <p>
